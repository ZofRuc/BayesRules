# BayesRules
The aim of this project was to investigate the factors influencing hotel reservation cancellations using logistic regression analysis. 
The analysis aimed to identify significant variables and develop predictive models for forecasting hotel reservation cancellations by customers. 
The dataset included information such as the number of days between booking and arrival date (lead time), average daily rate, whether the customer was a repeated guest (is_repeated_guest), and information about previous cancellations. 
Various metrics were used to assess the quality of the models, such as sensitivity, specificity, and overall accuracy.
